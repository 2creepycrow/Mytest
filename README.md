# Mytest

Just a maven project for a exam in a ED class.

To run this project as web project you need to compile it and build the package with "mvn compile" and "mvn package" then use the command "mvn jetty:run" and the server will start. 

Go to the browser and open the local host "localhost:9999" now you can use the web app.
